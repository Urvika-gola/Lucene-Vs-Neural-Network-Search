        "paperAbstract": "  Count distinct or cardinality estimates are widely used in network monitoring\nfor security. They can be used, for example, to detect the malware spread,\nnetwork scans, or a denial of service attack. There are many algorithms to\nestimate cardinality. Among those, HyperLogLog (HLL) has been one of the most\nwidely adopted. HLL is simple, provides good cardinality estimates over a wide\nrange of values, requires a small amount of memory, and allows merging of\nestimates from different sources. However, as HLL is increasingly used to\ndetect attacks, it can itself become the target of attackers that want to avoid\nbeing detected. To the best of our knowledge, the security of HLL has not been\nstudied before. In this letter, we take an initial step in its study by first\nexposing a vulnerability of HLL that allows an attacker to manipulate its\nestimate. This shows the importance of designing secure HLL implementations. In\nthe second part of the letter, we propose an efficient protection technique to\ndetect and avoid the HLL manipulation. The results presented strongly suggest\nthat the security of HLL should be further studied given that it is widely\nadopted in many networking and computing applications.\n",

        "paperAbstract": "  Spatial safety violations are the root cause of many security attacks and\nunexpected behavior of applications. Existing techniques to enforce spatial\nsafety work broadly at either object or pointer granularity. Object-based\napproaches tend to incur high CPU overheads, whereas pointer-based approaches\nincur both high CPU and memory overheads. SGXBounds, an object-based approach,\nis so far the most efficient technique that provides complete out-of-bounds\nprotection for objects. However, a major drawback of this approach is that it\ncan\u0027t support address space larger than 32-bit.\n  In this paper, we present CGuard, a tool that provides object-bounds\nprotection for C applications with comparable overheads to SGXBounds without\nrestricting the application address space. CGuard stores the bounds information\njust before the base address of an object and encodes the relative offset of\nthe base address in the spare bits of the virtual address available in x86_64\narchitecture. For an object that can\u0027t fit in the spare bits, CGuard uses a\ncustom memory layout that enables it to find the base address of the object in\njust one memory access. Our study revealed spatial safety violations in the gcc\nand x264 benchmarks from the SPEC CPU2017 benchmark suite and the string_match\nbenchmark from the Phoenix benchmark suite. The execution time overheads for\nthe SPEC CPU2017 and Phoenix benchmark suites were 42% and 26% respectively,\nwhereas the reduction in the throughput for the Apache webserver when the CPUs\nwere fully saturated was 30%. These results indicate that CGuard can be highly\neffective while maintaining a reasonable degree of efficiency.\n",

However, the repair data\nsent from a helper node to another failed node may vary with different repair\ngroups or the sets of helper nodes, which would inevitably leak more data\ninformation to the eavesdropper and even render the storage system unable to\nmaintain any data secrecy.\n  In this paper, we introduce and study a special category of MSCR codes,\ntermed \"\\emph{stable}\" MSCR codes, where the repair data from any one helper\nnode to any one failed node is required to be independent of the repair group\nor the set of helper nodes.

It allows\nsignificantly shorter public keys than the McEliece scheme. In this paper, we\ngive a polynomial time algorithm that recovers the encapsulated secret.

We obtain this result by\nobserving that recovering the error in the McEliece scheme corresponding to\nEdon-K can be viewed as a decoding problem for the rank-metric. We show that\nthe code used in Edon-K is in fact a super-code of a Low Rank Parity Check\n(LRPC) code of very small rank (1 or 2). A suitable parity-check matrix for the\nsuper-code of such low rank can be easily derived from for the public key.

Motivated by this, we\npropose a novel self-supervised Character-to-Character Distillation method,\nCCD, which enables versatile augmentations to facilitate general text\nrepresentation learning. Specifically, we delineate the character structures of\nunlabeled real images by designing a self-supervised character segmentation\nmodule. Following this, CCD easily enriches the diversity of local characters\nwhile keeping their pairwise alignment under flexible augmentations, using the\ntransformation matrix between two augmented views from images. Experiments\ndemonstrate that CCD achieves state-of-the-art results, with average\nperformance gains of 1.38% in text recognition, 1.7% in text segmentation, 0.24\ndB (PSNR) and 0.0321 (SSIM) in text super-resolution.

        "paperAbstract": "  Existing facial image super-resolution (SR) methods focus mostly on improving\nartificially down-sampled low-resolution (LR) imagery. Such SR models, although\nstrong at handling artificial LR images, often suffer from significant\nperformance drop on genuine LR test data. Previous unsupervised domain\nadaptation (UDA) methods address this issue by training a model using unpaired\ngenuine LR and HR data as well as cycle consistency loss formulation. However,\nthis renders the model overstretched with two tasks: consistifying the visual\ncharacteristics and enhancing the image resolution. Importantly, this makes the\nend-to-end model training ineffective due to the difficulty of back-propagating\ngradients through two concatenated CNNs. To solve this problem, we formulate a\nmethod that joins the advantages of conventional SR and UDA models.\nSpecifically, we separate and control the optimisations for characteristics\nconsistifying and image super-resolving by introducing Characteristic\nRegularisation (CR) between them. This task split makes the model training more\neffective and computationally tractable. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the\nperformance superiority of our method over state-of-the-art SR and UDA models\non both genuine and artificial LR facial imagery data.\n",

To ensure\nthe effectiveness of the workload simulation, it is necessary to dynamically\nevaluate the similarity of system inner status using key performance\nindicators(KPIs), which provide a comprehensive record of the system status,\nbetween the simulated workload and real workload by injecting workload into the\nsystem. However, due to the characteristics of KPIs, including large data size,\namplitude differences, phase shifts, non-smoothness, high dimension, and Large\nnumerical span, it is unpractical to evaluation on the full volume of KPIs and\nis challenging to measure the similarity between KPIs. In this paper, we\npropose a similarity metric algorithm for KPIs, extend shape-based\ndistance(ESBD), which describes both shape and intensity similarity. Around\nESBD, a KPIs-based quality evaluation of workload simulation(KEWS) was\nproposed, which consists of four steps: KPIs preprocessing, KPIs screening,\nKPIs clustering, and KPIs evaluation. These techniques help mitigate the\nnegative impact of the KPIs characteristics and give a comprehensive evaluation\nresult.

The prediction of HPC variability is a challenging\nproblem in the engineering of HPC systems and there is little statistical work\non this problem to date.

Traditionally, Automatic Traffic\nRecorders (ATR) are used to collect this hourly volume data. These large\ndatasets are time series data characterized by long-term temporal dependencies\nand missing values. Regarding the temporal dependencies, all roadways are\ncharacterized by seasonal variations that can be weekly, monthly or yearly,\ndepending on the cause of the variation. Regarding the missing data in a\ntime-series sequence, traditional time series forecasting models perform poorly\nunder the influence of seasonal variations. To address this limitation, robust,\nRecurrent Neural Network (RNN) based, multi-step ahead forecasting models are\ndeveloped for time-series in this study. The simple RNN, the Gated Recurrent\nUnit (GRU) and the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units are used to develop the\nmodel and evaluate its performance. Two approaches are used to address the\nmissing value issue: masking and imputation, in conjunction with the RNN\nmodels. Six different imputation algorithms are then used to identify the best\nmodel. The analysis indicates that the LSTM model performs better than simple\nRNN and GRU models, and imputation performs better than masking to predict\nfuture traffic volume. Based on analysis using 92 ATRs, the LSTM-Median model\nis deemed the best model in all scenarios for hourly traffic volume and AADT\nprediction, with an average RMSE of 274 and MAPE of 18.91% for hourly traffic\nvolume prediction and average RMSE of 824 and MAPE of 2.10% for AADT\nprediction.\n",

This feature consists\nin an automatic reporting of the radio measurements associated with the\ngeographic location of the user\u0027s mobile device.

The paper focuses on the reduction of the computational\ncomplexity of the Kriging algorithm by applying Fixed Rank Kriging (FRK). The\nperformance evaluation of the FRK algorithm both on simulated measurements and\nreal field measurements shows a good trade-off between prediction efficiency\nand computational complexity.

This puts on a firm ground a\nknown statement that the algebra $\\cal{A}$ ``looks and behaves like a universal\nenveloping algebra\u0027\u0027. An immediate corollary of our result is the conjecture of\nBar-Natan, Garoufalidis, Rozansky, and Thurston on the Kirillov-Duflo\nisomorphism for algebras of chord diagrams.\n  Our main tool is a general construction of a functor from the category\n$\\mathtt{CycOp}$ of cyclic operads to the category $\\mathtt{ModOp}$ of modular\noperads which is left adjoint to the ``tree part\u0027\u0027 functor $\\mathtt{ModOp} \\to\n\\mathtt{CycOp}$.

        "paperAbstract": "  The money supply is endogenous if the monetary policy strategy is the so\ncalled Inflation and Interest Rate Targeting, IRT. With that and perfect\ncredibility, the theory of the price level and inflation only needs the Fisher\nequation, but it interprets causality in a new sense: if the monetary authority\nraises the policy rate, it will raise the inflation target, and vice versa,\ngiven the natural interest rate. If credibility is not perfect or if\nexpectations are not completely rational, the theory needs something more. Here\nI present a model corresponding to this theory that includes both the steady\nstate case and the recovery dynamics after a supply shock, with and without\npolicy reactions to such a shock. But, under the finite horizon assumption for\nIRT, at some future point in time the money supply must become exogenous. This\ncreates the incentive for agents to examine, as of today, statistics on\nmonetary aggregates and form their forecasts of money supply growth and\ninflation rates. Additionally, inflation models of the small open economy allow\nus to deduce that the IRT in this case is much more powerful than otherwise,\nand for the same degree of credibility. But things are not necessarily easier\nfor the monetary authority: it must monitor not only internal indicators, but\nalso external inflation and its determinants, and it must, in certain\ncircumstances, make more intense adjustments to the interest rate.\n",

Despite\nmany efforts, the precise underlying reasons are yet to be discovered. We study\nthe role of linear causality in the VIX index and its derivatives during\nJanuary and February 2018. Due to the shortcomings of statistical inferences\nfor stochastic volatility models, the dynamics of the volatility expectation\nindex VIX remain controversial.

Here we explore\nthe concept that dark matter is sterile neutrinos, particles that are commonly\nreferred to as Warm Dark Matter. Such particles have keV masses, and decay over\na very long time, much longer than the Hubble time. In their decay they produce\nX-ray photons which modify the ionization balance in the very early universe,\nincreasing the fraction of molecular Hydrogen, and thus help early star\nformation. Sterile neutrinos may also help to understand the baryon-asymmetry,\nthe pulsar kicks, the early growth of black holes, the minimum mass of dwarf\nspheroidal galaxies, as well as the shape and smoothness of dark matter halos.\nAs soon as all these tests have been made quantitative in their various\nparameters, we may focus on the creation mechanism of these particles, and\ncould predict the strength of the sharp X-ray emission line, expected from any\nlarge dark matter assembly. A measurement of this X-ray emission line would be\ndefinitive proof for the existence of may be called weakly interacting\nneutrinos, or WINs.\n",

We argue that using statistical\ndata from a batch fails to capture the crucial information for each input\ninstance in BNN computations, and the differences between statistical\ninformation computed from each instance need to be considered when determining\nthe binary activation threshold of each instance. Based on the concept, we\npropose the Binary Neural Network with INSTAnce-aware threshold (INSTA-BNN),\nwhich decides the activation threshold value considering the difference between\nstatistical data computed from a batch and each instance. The proposed\nINSTA-BNN outperforms the baseline by 2.5% and 2.3% on the ImageNet\nclassification task with comparable computing cost, achieving 68.0% and 71.7%\ntop-1 accuracy on ResNet-18 and MobileNetV1 based models, respectively.\n",

        "paperAbstract": "  Big data sets must be carefully partitioned into statistically similar data\nsubsets that can be used as representative samples for big data analysis tasks.\nIn this paper, we propose the random sample partition (RSP) data model to\nrepresent a big data set as a set of non-overlapping data subsets, called RSP\ndata blocks, where each RSP data block has a probability distribution similar\nto the whole big data set. Under this data model, efficient block level\nsampling is used to randomly select RSP data blocks, replacing expensive record\nlevel sampling to select sample data from a big distributed data set on a\ncomputing cluster. We show how RSP data blocks can be employed to estimate\nstatistics of a big data set and build models which are equivalent to those\nbuilt from the whole big data set. In this approach, analysis of a big data set\nbecomes analysis of few RSP data blocks which have been generated in advance on\nthe computing cluster. Therefore, the new method for data analysis based on RSP\ndata blocks is scalable to big data.\n",

        "paperAbstract": "  Galaxies in clusters are gas-deficient and a number of possible explanations\nfor this observation have been advanced, including galaxy-cluster tidal\ninteractions, galaxy harassment, and ISM-ICM gas stripping. In this paper, we\nuse a cosmological simulation of cluster formation and evolution in order to\nexamine this issue from a theoretical standpoint. We follow a large number of\ngalaxies over time and track each galaxy\u0027s gas and stellar mass changes to\ndiscover what mechanism(s) dominate the evolution of the cluster galaxies. We\nfind that while gas is lost due to a wide variety of mechanisms, the most\ncommon way is via a gas-only stripping event, and the amount of gas lost\ncorrelates with the ram-pressure the galaxy is experiencing. Although this\ngas-stripping occurs primarily in the central region (r \u003c 1 Mpc), it is an\nimportant mechanism out to the virial radius of the cluster. This is due to the\nwide scatter in ram-pressure strength that a galaxy experiences at fixed\nradius. We find that the timescale for complete gas removal is \u003e 1 Gyr. In\naddition, we find that galaxies in the field and in the cluster periphery (r \u003e\n2.4 Mpc) often accrete cool gas; the accretion stops between 1-2.4 Mpc,\npossibly indicating the onset of galaxy starvation.\n",

Using the Eulerian hydrodynamics/N-body code COSMOS, we simulate\nmergers between nonisothermal, hydrostatic clusters with a steep central dark\nmatter density profile and a beta-model gas profile. We constrain global\nproperties of the model clusters using observed cluster statistical\nrelationships. We consider impact parameters between zero and five times the\nscale radius and mass ratios of 1:1 and 1:3. The morphological changes,\nrelative velocities, and temperature jumps we observe agree with previous\nstudies using the King profile for the dark matter. We observe a larger jump in\nX-ray luminosity (~4-10x) than in previous work, and we argue that this\nincrease is most likely a lower limit due to our spatial resolution. We\nemphasize that luminosity and temperature jumps due to mergers may have an\nimportant bearing on constraints on Omega derived from the observation of hot\nclusters at high redshift. Shocks are relatively weak in the cluster cores;\nhence they do not significantly increase the entropy there. Instead, shocks\ncreate entropy in the outer regions, and this high-entropy gas is mixed with\nthe core gas during later stages of the merger. Ram pressure initiates mixing\nby displacing the core gas from its potential center, causing it to become\nconvectively unstable. The resulting convective plumes produce large-scale\nturbulent motions with eddy sizes up to several 100 kpc. This turbulence is\npumped by dark matter-driven oscillations in the gravitational potential. Even\nafter nearly a Hubble time these motions persist as subsonic turbulence in the\ncluster cores, providing 5-10% of the support against gravity.\n",

All three simulations show a decrease in the number of quiescent,\nisolated galaxies in the mass range $\\mathrm{M}_* \u003d 10^{9-10} \\\n\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$, in broad agreement with observations.

To quantify the impact of these schemes, we generate zeroth\nmoment (surface density) maps of the inferred HI distribution; construct power\nspectra associated with the underlying structure of the simulated cold ISM, in\naddition to their radial surface density and velocity dispersion profiles.

Single power-law fits\n(P~k^gamma) to the power spectra of the stronger-feedback (MaGICC) runs (over\nspatial scales corresponding to 0.5 kpc to 20 kpc) result in slopes consistent\nwith those seen in the THINGS sample (gamma \u003d -2.5).

We constrain the signatures of AGN feedback on the 1D power spectrum of\nthe Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest using a series of eight hydro-cosmological\nsimulations performed with the Adaptative Mesh Refinement code RAMSES. This\nseries starts from the Horizon-AGN simulation and varies the sub-grid\nparameters for AGN feeding, feedback and stochasticity. These simulations cover\nthe whole plausible range of feedback and feeding parameters according to the\nresulting galaxy properties. AGNs globally suppress the Lyman-$\\alpha$ power at\nall scales.

In order to understand the dust\nevolution in elliptical galaxies, we construct a simple model that includes\ndust growth in the cold gas and dust destruction in the hot gas. We also take\ninto account the effect of mass exchange between these two gas components\ninduced by active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback.

By comparing\nwith an observational sample of nearby elliptical galaxies, we find that,\nalthough the dust-to-gas ratio varies by an order of magnitude in our model,\nthe entire range of the observed dust-to-gas ratios is difficult to be\nreproduced under a single parameter set. Variation of the dust growth\nefficiency is the most probable solution to explain the large variety in\ndust-to-gas ratio of the observational sample.

Our model assumes that seed\nblack holes are present at early cosmic epochs at the centres of forming halos.\nWe then track their growth from gas accretion and mergers with other black\nholes in the course of cosmic time. For black holes that are active, we\ndistinguish between two distinct modes of feedback, depending on the black hole\naccretion rate itself. Black holes that accrete at high rates are assumed to be\nin a `quasar regime\u0027, where we model their feedback by thermally coupling a\nsmall fraction of their bolometric luminosity to the surrounding gas. For black\nholes with low accretion rates, we conjecture that most of their feedback\noccurs in mechanical form, where AGN-driven bubbles are injected into a gaseous\nenvironment. Using our new model, we carry out TreeSPH cosmological simulations\non the scales of individual galaxies to those of massive galaxy clusters, both\nfor isolated systems and for cosmological boxes.

In this paper we perform a joint counts-in-cells analysis on\ngalaxies in the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey, classified by both colour and\nspectral type, eta, as early or late type galaxies. We fit three different\nmodels of relative bias to the joint probability distribution of the cell\ncounts, assuming Poisson sampling of the galaxy density field. We investigate\nthe nonlinearity and stochasticity of the relative bias, with cubical cells of\nside 10Mpc \\leq L \\leq 45Mpc (h\u003d0.7). Exact linear bias is ruled out with high\nsignificance on all scales. Power law bias gives a better fit, but likelihood\nratios prefer a bivariate lognormal distribution, with a non-zero\n`stochasticity\u0027 - i.e. scatter that may result from physical effects on galaxy\nformation other than those from the local density field. Using this model, we\nmeasure a correlation coefficient in log-density space (r_LN) of 0.958 for\ncells of length L\u003d10Mpc, increasing to 0.970 by L\u003d45Mpc. This corresponds to a\nstochasticity sigma_b/bhat of 0.44\\pm0.02 and 0.27\\pm0.05 respectively. For\nsmaller cells, the Poisson sampled lognormal distribution presents an\nincreasingly poor fit to the data, especially with regard to the fraction of\ncompletely empty cells. We compare these trends with the predictions of\nsemianalytic galaxy formation models: these match the data well in terms of\noverall level of stochasticity, variation with scale, and fraction of empty\ncells.\n",

        "paperAbstract": "  High resolution (R \u003e 40 000) and high S/N spectra have been acquired with\nUVES on the VLT-Kueyen (Paranal Observatory, ESO Chile) for several main\nsequence turnoff stars (V ~ 17 mag) and subgiants at the base of the Red Giant\nBranch (V ~ 16 mag) in three globular clusters (NGC 6397, NGC 6752 and 47\nTuc/NGC 104) at different metallicities (respectively [Fe/H] \u003d -2.0; -1.5;\n-0.7$). Spectra for a sample of 25 field halo subdwarves have also been taken\nwith equal resolution, but higher S/N. These data have been used to determine\nthe abundances of several neutron-capture elements in these three clusters:\nstrontium, yttrium, barium and europium. This is the first abundance\ndetermination of these heavy elements for such unevolved stars in these three\nglobular clusters. These values, together with the [Ba/Eu] and [Sr/Ba]\nabundance ratios, have been used to test the self-enrichment scenario. A\ncomparison is done with field halo stars and other well known Galactic globular\nclusters in which heavy elements have already been measured in the past, at\nleast in bright giants (V \u003e 11-12 mag). Our results show clearly that globular\nclusters have been uniformly enriched by r- and s-process syntheses, and that\nmost of them seem to follow exactly the same abundance patterns as field halo\nstars, which discards the ``classical\u0027\u0027 self-enrichment scenario for the origin\nof metallicities and heavy elements in globular clusters.\n",

        "title": "A Comparison of Elemental Abundance Ratios in Globular Clusters, Field\n  Stars, and Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies",
        "paperAbstract": "  We have compiled a sample of globular clusters with high quality stellar\nabundances from the literature to compare to the chemistries of stars in the\nGalaxy and those in dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Of the 45 globular clusters\nexamined, 29 also have kinematic information. Most of the globular clusters\nbelong to the Galactic halo, however a signficant number have disk kinematics\nor belong to the bulge. Focusing on the [alpha/Fe] and light r-process element\nratios, we find that most globular cluster stars mimic those of the field stars\nof similar metallicities, and neither clearly resembles the presently available\nstellar abundances in the dwarf galaxies (including the globular clusters in\nthe Large Magellanic Cloud). The exceptions to these general elemental ratio\ncomparisons are already known in the literature, e.g., omega Centauri, Palomar\n12, and Terzan 7 associated with the Sagittarius remnant, and Ruprecht 106\nwhich has a high radial velocity and low [alpha/Fe] ratio. A few other globular\nclusters show more marginal peculiarities. The most notable one being the halo\ncluster M68 which has a high Galactocentric rotational velocity, a slightly\nyounger age, and a unique [Si/Ti] ratio. The [Si/Ti] ratios decrease with\nincreasing [Fe/H] at intermediate metallicities, which is consistent with very\nmassive stars playing a larger role in the early chemical evolution of the\nGalaxy. The chemical similarities between globular clusters and field stars\nwith [Fe/H]\u003c-1.0 suggests a shared chemical history in a well mixed early\nGalaxy. The differences to the published chemistries of stars in the dwarf\nspheroidal galaxies suggests that neither the globular clusters, halo stars,\nnor thick disk stars had their origins in small isolated systems like the\npresent-day Milky Way dwarf satellites.\n",

This is the third paper of a series resulting from a large project aimed\nat determining the extent of the Na-O anticorrelation among Globular Cluster\nstars and exploring its relationship with HB morphology. We present an LTE\nabundance analysis of these objects, based on data gathered with the FLAMES\nfiber facility and the UVES spectrograph at VLT2. Five of the thirteen stars\nobserved are members of the cluster. The average Fe abundance for these five\nstars is [Fe/H]\u003d$-0.39\\pm 0.04\\pm 0.05$~dex, where the first error bar includes\nthe uncertainties related to star-to-star random errors, and the second one the\nsystematic effects related to the various assumptions made in the analysis.The\noverall abundance pattern is quite typical of Globular Clusters, with an excess\nof the $\\alpha-$elements and of Eu. There is evidence that the stars of NGC\n6441 are enriched in Na and Al, while they have been depleted of O and Mg, due\nto H-burning at high temperatures, in analogy with extensive observations for\nother Globular Clusters: in particular, one star is clearly Na and Al-rich and\nO and Mg-poor. We obtained also quite high V abundances, but it is possible\nthat this is an artifact of the analysis, since similar large V abundances are\nderived also for the field stars. These last are all more metal-rich than NGC\n6441 and probably belong to the bulge population.\n",

Our [Fe/H] values range from --2.10 to\n--0.97, confirming previous findings of a large metallicity spread. We have\ncombined our data with similar data for five Sculptor giants studied recently\nto form one of the largest samples of high resolution abundances yet obtained\nfor a dwarf spheroidal galaxy, covering essentially the full known metallicity\nrange. These properties allow us to establish trends of [X/Fe] with [Fe/H] for\nmany elements, X. The trends are significantly different from the trends seen\nin galactic halo and globular cluster stars. We compare our Sculptor sample to\ntheir most similar Galactic counterparts and find substantial differences\nremain even with these stars. The many discrepancies in the relationships\nbetween [X/Fe] as seen in Sculptor compared with Galactic field stars indicates\nthat our halo cannot be made up in bulk of stars similar to those presently\nseen in dwarf spheroidal galaxies like Sculptor. These results have serious\nimplications for the Searle-Zinn and hierarchical galaxy formation scenarios.\nWe also find that the most metal-rich star in our sample is a heavy\nelement-rich star. A very high percentage of such heavy element stars are now\nknown in dwarf spheroidals compared to the halo, further mitigating against the\nformation of the halo from such objects.\n",

Variations in condensate retention and accompanying\nchanges in local lapse rate may substantially affect planetary climate and\nsurface conditions, but there is currently no general theory to effectively\ndescribe such atmospheres. In this article, expanding on the work by Li et al.\n(2018), we generalize the single-component moist pseudoadiabat derivation in\nPierrehumbert (2010) to allow for multiple condensing components of arbitrary\ndiluteness and retained condensate fraction. The introduction of a freely\ntunable retained condensate fraction allows for a flexible, self-consistent\ntreatment of atmospheres with non-dilute condensable components. To test the\npseudoadiabat\u0027s capabilities for simulating a diverse range of climates, we\napply the formula to planetary atmospheres with compositions, surface\npressures, and temperatures representing important stages with condensable-rich\natmospheres in the evolution of terrestrial planets: a magma ocean planet in a\nrunaway greenhouse state; a post-impact, late veneer-analogue planet with a\ncomplex atmospheric composition; and an Archean Earth-like planet near the\nouter edge of the classical circumstellar habitable zone. We find that\nvariations in the retention of multiple non-dilute condensable species can\nsignificantly affect the lapse rate and in turn outgoing radiation and the\nspectral signatures of planetary atmospheres.

The\nbinary star formation process is studied paying particular attention to the\nfragmentation of a rotating magnetized molecular cloud. We assume an isothermal\nrotating and magnetized cylindrical cloud in hydrostatic balance.\nNon-axisymmetric as well as axisymmetric perturbations are added to the initial\nstate and the subsequent evolutions are studied. The evolution is characterized\nby three parameters: the amplitude of the non-axisymmetric perturbations, the\nrotation speed, and the magnetic field strength. As a result, it is found that\nnon-axisymmetry hardly evolves in the early phase, but begins to grow after the\ngas contracts and forms a thin disk. Disk formation is strongly promoted by the\nrotation speed and the magnetic field strength. There are two types of\nfragmentation: fragmentation from a ring and that from a bar. Thin adiabatic\ncores fragment if a thickness is smaller than 1/4 of the radius. For the\nfragments to survive, they should be formed in a heavily elongated barred core\nor a flat round disk.

However, their co-evolution with these processes has still not been\nthoroughly investigated, and the possible effect of the initial conditions is\nlargely unknown. This letter presents the first results from a series of\nhigh-resolution numerical models, aimed at deciphering the effect of the\ninitial conditions and of stellar feedback on the evolution of the galactic\nmagnetic field in isolated, Milky-Way-like galaxies. The models start with an\nordered, either poloidal or toroidal, magnetic field of varying strength, and\nare evolved with and without supernova feedback. They include a dark matter\nhalo, a stellar and a gaseous disk, as well as the appropriate cooling and\nheating processes for the interstellar medium. Independently of the initial\nconditions, the galaxies develop a turbulent velocity field and a random\nmagnetic field component in under 15 Myrs. Supernova feedback is extremely\nefficient in building a random magnetic field component up to large galactic\nheights. However, a random magnetic field emerges even in runs without\nfeedback, which points to an inherent instability of the ordered component.\nSupernova feedback greatly affects the velocity field of the galaxy up to large\ngalactic heights, and helps restructure the magnetic field up to 10 kpc above\nthe disk, independently of the initial magnetic field morphology. On the other\nhand, the initial morphology of the magnetic field can accelerate the\ndevelopment of a random component at large heights.

We find that the bar\ninduces both azimuth angle- and radius-dependent trends in the median distance\nthat stars have travelled to enter a given annulus. Angle-dependent trends are\npresent at all radii we consider, and the radius-dependent trends roughly\ndivide the disc into three \u0027zones\u0027. In the inner zone, stars generally\noriginated at larger radii and their orbits evolved inwards. Stars in the outer\nzone likely originated at smaller radii and their orbits evolved outwards. In\nthe intermediate zone, there is no net inwards or outwards evolution of orbits.\nWe adopt a simple radius-dependent initial metallicity gradient and discuss\nrecent observational evidence for angle-dependent stellar metallicity\nvariations in the Milky Way in the context of this toy model. We briefly\ncomment on the possibility of using observed angle-dependent metallicity trends\nto learn about the initial metallicity gradient(s) and the radial\nre-arrangement that occurred in the disc.\n",

        "paperAbstract": "  We explore the effect of using different kinematic tracers (HI and H$\\alpha$)\non reconstructing the encounter parameters of the Mice major galaxy merger (NGC\n4676A/B). We observed the Mice using the SparsePak Integral Field Unit (IFU) on\nthe WIYN telescope, and compared the H$\\alpha$ velocity map with VLA HI\nobservations. The relatively high spectral resolution of our data (R $\\approx$\n5000) allows us to resolve more than one kinematic component in the emission\nlines of some fibers. We separate the H$\\alpha$-[N II] emission of the\nstar-forming regions from shocks using their [N II]/H$\\alpha$ line ratio and\nvelocity dispersion. We show that the velocity of star-forming regions agree\nwith that of the cold gas (HI), particularly, in the tidal tails of the system.\nWe reconstruct the morphology and kinematics of these tidal tails utilizing an\nautomated modeling method based on the Identikit software package. We quantify\nthe goodness of fit and the uncertainties of the derived encounter parameters.\nMost of the initial conditions reconstructed using H$\\alpha$ and HI are\nconsistent with each other, and qualitatively agree with the results of\nprevious works. For example, we find 210$\\pm^{50}_{40}$ Myrs, and\n180$\\pm^{50}_{40}$ Myrs for the time since pericenter, when modeling H$\\alpha$\nand HI kinematics, respectively. This confirms that in some cases, H$\\alpha$\nkinematics can be used instead of HI kinematics for reconstructing the initial\nconditions of galaxy mergers, and our automated modeling method is applicable\nto some merging systems.\n",

        "paperAbstract": "  Studies of the ages, abundances, and motions of individual stars in the Milky\nWay provide one of the best ways to study the evolution of disk galaxies over\ncosmic time. The formation of the Milky Way\u0027s barred inner region in particular\nis a crucial piece of the puzzle of disk galaxy evolution. Using data from\nAPOGEE and Gaia, we present maps of the kinematics, elemental abundances, and\nage of the Milky Way bulge and disk that show the barred structure of the inner\nMilky Way in unprecedented detail. The kinematic maps allow a direct, purely\nkinematic determination of the bar\u0027s pattern speed of 41+/-3 km/s/kpc and of\nits shape and radial profile. We find the bar\u0027s age, metallicity, and abundance\nratios to be the same as those of the oldest stars in the disk that are formed\nin its turbulent beginnings, while stars in the bulge outside of the bar are\nyounger and more metal-rich. This implies that the bar likely formed ~8 Gyr\nago, when the decrease in turbulence in the gas disk allowed a thin disk to\nform that quickly became bar-unstable. The bar\u0027s formation therefore stands as\na crucial epoch in the evolution of the Milky Way, a picture that is in line\nwith the evolutionary path that emerges from observations of the gas kinematics\nin external disk galaxies over the last ~10 Gyr.\n",

        "paperAbstract": "  Galactic disc chemical evolution models generally ignore azimuthal surface\ndensity variation that can introduce chemical abundance azimuthal gradients.\nRecent observations, however, have revealed chemical abundance changes with\nazimuth in the gas and stellar components of both the Milky Way and external\ngalaxies. To quantify the effects of spiral arm density fluctuations on the\nazimuthal variations of the oxygen and iron abundances in disc galaxies. We\ndevelop a new 2D galactic disc chemical evolution model, capable of following\nnot just radial but also azimuthal inhomogeneities. The density fluctuations\nresulting from a Milky Way-like N-body disc formation simulation produce\nazimuthal variations in the oxygen abundance gradients of the order of 0.1 dex.\nMoreover, in agreement with the most recent observations in external galaxies,\nthe azimuthal variations are more evident in the outer galactic regions. Using\na simple analytical model, we show that the largest fluctuations with azimuth\nresult near the spiral structure corotation resonance, where the relative speed\nbetween spiral and gaseous disc is the slowest. In conclusion we provided a new\n2D chemical evolution model capable of following azimuthal density variations.\nDensity fluctuations extracted from a Milky Way-like dynamical model lead to a\nscatter in the azimuthal variations of the oxygen abundance gradient in\nagreement with observations in external galaxies. We interpret the presence of\nazimuthal scatter at all radii by the presence of multiple spiral modes moving\nat different pattern speeds, as found in both observations and numerical\nsimulations.\n",
