In this paper, we propose a Region\nRefinement Network (RRN), which recurrently filters redundant information and\nexplicitly models boundary information for saliency detection. Different from\nexisting refinement methods, we propose a Region Refinement Module (RRM) that\noptimizes salient region prediction by incorporating supervised attention masks\nin the intermediate refinement stages. The module only brings a minor increase\nin model size and yet significantly reduces false predictions from the\nbackground. To further refine boundary areas, we propose a Boundary Refinement\nLoss (BRL) that adds extra supervision for better distinguishing foreground\nfrom background. BRL is parameter free and easy to train. We further observe\nthat BRL helps retain the integrity in prediction by refining the boundary.\nExtensive experiments on saliency detection datasets show that our refinement\nmodule and loss bring significant improvement to the baseline and can be easily\napplied to different frameworks. We also demonstrate that our proposed model\ngeneralizes well to portrait segmentation and shadow detection tasks.\n",

However,\ncurrent GAN-based inpainting models fail to explicitly consider the semantic\nconsistency between restored images and original images. Forexample, given a\nmale image with image region of one eye missing, current models may restore it\nwith a female eye. This is due to the ambiguity of GAN-based inpainting models:\nthese models can generate many possible restorations given a missing region. To\naddress this limitation, our key insight is that semantically interpretable\ninformation (such as attribute and segmentation information) of input images\n(with missing regions) can provide essential guidance for the inpainting\nprocess. Based on this insight, we propose a boosted GAN with semantically\ninterpretable information for image inpainting that consists of an inpainting\nnetwork and a discriminative network. The inpainting network utilizes two\nauxiliary pretrained networks to discover the attribute and segmentation\ninformation of input images and incorporates them into the inpainting process\nto provide explicit semantic-level guidance. The discriminative network adopts\na multi-level design that can enforce regularizations not only on overall\nrealness but also on attribute and segmentation consistency with the original\nimages. Experimental results show that our proposed model can preserve\nconsistency on both attribute and segmentation level, and significantly\noutperforms the state-of-the-art models.\n",

In electronic devices, shot noise arises from the\ndiscrete nature of charge carriers and it increases linearly with the applied\nvoltage according to the celebrated Schottky formula. Nonetheless, measurements\nof shot noise in atomic-scale junctions at high voltage reveal significant\nnonlinear (anomalous) behavior, which varies from sample to sample, and has no\nspecific trend. Here, we provide a viable, unifying explanation for these\ndiverse observations based on the theory of quantum coherent transport. Our\nformula for the anomalous shot noise relies on---and allows us to resolve---two\nkey characteristics of a conducting junction: The structure of the transmission\nfunction at the vicinity of the Fermi energy and the asymmetry of the bias\nvoltage drop at the contacts. We tested our theory on high voltage shot noise\nmeasurements on Au atomic scale junctions and demonstrated a quantitative\nagreement, recovering both the enhancement and suppression of shot noise as\nobserved in different junctions. The good theory-experiment correspondence\nsupports our modelling and emphasizes that the asymmetry of the bias drop on\nthe contacts is a key factor in nanoscale electronic transport, which may\nsubstantially impact electronic signals even in incomplex structures.\n",

        "paperAbstract": "  One of the biggest challenges impeding the progress of Metal-Oxide-Silicon\n(MOS) quantum dot devices is the presence of disorder at the Si/SiO$_2$\ninterface which interferes with controllably confining single and few\nelectrons. In this work we have engineered a low-disorder MOS quantum\ndouble-dot device with critical electron densities, i.e. the lowest electron\ndensity required to support a conducting pathway, approaching critical electron\ndensities reported in high quality Si/SiGe devices and commensurate with the\nlowest critical densities reported in any MOS device. Utilizing a nearby charge\nsensor, we show that the device can be tuned to the single-electron regime\nwhere charging energies of $\\approx$8 meV are measured in both dots, consistent\nwith the lithographic size of the dot. Probing a wide voltage range with our\nquantum dots and charge sensor, we detect three distinct electron traps,\ncorresponding to a defect density consistent with the ensemble measured\ncritical density. Low frequency charge noise measurements at 300 mK indicate a\n1/$f$ noise spectrum of 3.4 $\\mu$eV/Hz$^{1/2}$ at 1 Hz and magnetospectroscopy\nmeasurements yield a valley splitting of 110$\\pm$26 $\\mu$eV. This work\ndemonstrates that reproducible MOS spin qubits are feasible and represents a\nplatform for scaling to larger qubit systems in MOS.\n",

        "paperAbstract": "  Electron spins in silicon quantum dots provide a promising route towards\nrealising the large number of coupled qubits required for a useful quantum\nprocessor. At present, the requisite single-shot spin qubit measurements are\nperformed using on-chip charge sensors, capacitively coupled to the quantum\ndots. However, as the number of qubits is increased, this approach becomes\nimpractical due to the footprint and complexity of the charge sensors, combined\nwith the required proximity to the quantum dots. Alternatively, the spin state\ncan be measured directly by detecting the complex impedance of spin-dependent\nelectron tunnelling between quantum dots. This can be achieved using\nradio-frequency reflectometry on a single gate electrode defining the quantum\ndot itself, significantly reducing gate count and architectural complexity, but\nthus far it has not been possible to achieve single-shot spin readout using\nthis technique. Here, we detect single electron tunnelling in a double quantum\ndot and demonstrate that gate-based sensing can be used to read out the\nelectron spin state in a single shot, with an average readout fidelity of 73%.\nThe result demonstrates a key step towards the readout of many spin qubits in\nparallel, using a compact gate design that will be needed for a large-scale\nsemiconductor quantum processor.\n",

The Black-Scholes option pricing model is one of the most widely used\nmodels by market participants. Notwithstanding, the Black-Scholes model is\nbased on heavily criticized theoretical premises, one of which is the constant\nvolatility assumption. The dynamics of the volatility surface is difficult to\nestimate. In this paper, we establish a novel architecture based on\nphysics-informed neural networks and convolutional transformers. The\nperformance of the new architecture is directly compared to other well-known\ndeep-learning architectures, such as standard physics-informed neural networks,\nconvolutional long-short term memory (ConvLSTM), and self-attention ConvLSTM.\nNumerical evidence indicates that the proposed physics-informed convolutional\ntransformer network achieves a superior performance than other methods.\n",

        "paperAbstract": "  The study of epidemic models plays an important role in mathematical\nepidemiology. There are many researches on epidemic models using ordinary\ndifferential equations, partial differential equations or stochastic\ndifferential equations. In contrast to these researches, our work analyzes the\nSEIRS (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible) model using\nstochastic partial differential equations. Specifically, we consider the\neffects of spatial variables and space-time white noise on the epidemic model.\nIn the means of mild solution, we construct a contraction mapping and prove the\nwell-posedness for the stochastic partial differential equation using the fixed\npoint argument and the factorization method. We also find sufficient conditions\nfor permanence and extinction to determine the longtime behavior of the\nsolution. We hope that this work can provide some new ideas for the study of\nincreasingly complex epidemic models and related numerical simulations.\n",

        "paperAbstract": "  Non-pharmaceutical interventions(NPIs) play an important role in the early\nstage control of COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccination is considered to be the\ninevitable course to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Based on the mechanism, a\nSVEIR COVID-19 model with vaccination and NPIs is proposed. By means of the\nbasic reproduction number $R_{0}$, it is shown that the disease-free\nequilibrium is globally attractive if $\\mathscr{R}_{0}\u003c1$, and COVID-19 is\nuniform persistence if $\\mathscr{R}_{0}\u003e1$. Taking Indian dates for example in\nthe numerical simulation, we find that our dynamical results fits well with the\nstatistical dates. Consequently, we forecast the spreading trend of COVID-19\npandemic in India. Furthermore, our results imply that improving the intensity\nof NPIs will greatly reduce the number of confirmed cases. Especially, NPIs are\nindispensable even if all the people were vaccinated when the efficiency of\nvaccine is relatively low. By simulating the relation ships of the basic\nreproduction number $\\mathscr{R}_{0}$, the vaccination rate and the efficiency\nof vaccine, we find that it is impossible to achieve the herd immunity without\nNPIs when the efficiency of vaccine is lower than $76.9\\%$. Therefore, the herd\nimmunity area is defined by the evolution of relationships between the\nvaccination rate and the efficiency of vaccine. In the study of two patchy, we\ngive the conditions for India and China to be open to navigation. Furthermore,\nan appropriate dispersal of population between India and China is obtained.

        "title": "Bias due to neutrinos must not uncorrect\u0027d go",
        "paperAbstract": "  In cosmologies with massive neutrinos, the galaxy bias defined with respect\nto the total matter field (cold dark matter, baryons, and non-relativistic\nneutrinos) depends on the sum of the neutrino masses $M_{\\nu}$, and becomes\nscale-dependent even on large scales. This effect has been usually neglected\ngiven the sensitivity of current surveys, but becomes a severe systematic for\nfuture surveys aiming to provide the first detection of non-zero $M_{\\nu}$. The\neffect can be corrected for by defining the bias with respect to the density\nfield of cold dark matter and baryons instead of the total matter field. In\nthis work, we provide a simple prescription for correctly mitigating the\nneutrino-induced scale-dependent bias effect in a practical way. We clarify a\nnumber of subtleties regarding how to properly implement this correction in the\npresence of redshift-space distortions and non-linear evolution of\nperturbations. We perform a MCMC analysis on simulated galaxy clustering data\nthat match the expected sensitivity of the \\textit{Euclid} survey. We find that\nthe neutrino-induced scale-dependent bias can lead to important shifts in both\nthe inferred mean value of $M_{\\nu}$, as well as its uncertainty. We show how\nthese shifts propagate to other cosmological parameters correlated with\n$M_{\\nu}$, such as the cold dark matter physical density $\\Omega_{cdm} h^2$ and\nthe scalar spectral index $n_s$. In conclusion, we find that correctly\naccounting for the neutrino-induced scale-dependent bias will be of crucial\nimportance for future galaxy clustering analyses. We encourage the cosmology\ncommunity to correctly account for this effect using the simple prescription we\npresent in our work. The tools necessary to easily correct for the\nneutrino-induced scale-dependent bias will be made publicly available in an\nupcoming release of the Boltzmann solver \\texttt{CLASS}.\n",

This is the first time that $b_{\\phi\\delta}$ is\nmeasured from either gravity-only or galaxy formation simulations. For dark\nmatter halos, the popular assumption of universality overpredicts the\n$b_{\\phi\\delta}(b_1)$ relation in the range $1 \\lesssim b_1 \\lesssim 3$ by up\nto $\\Delta b_{\\phi\\delta} \\sim 3$ ($b_1$ is the linear density bias). The\nadequacy of the universality relation is worse for the simulated galaxies, with\nthe relations $b_{\\phi}(b_1)$ and $b_{\\phi\\delta}(b_1)$ being generically\nredshift-dependent and very sensitive to how galaxies are selected (we test\ntotal, stellar and black hole mass, black hole mass accretion rate and color).\nThe uncertainties on $b_{\\phi}$ and $b_{\\phi\\delta}$ have a direct, often\noverlooked impact on the constraints of the local PNG parameter $f_{\\rm NL}$,\nwhich we study and discuss. For a survey with $V \u003d 100{\\rm Gpc}^3/h^3$ at\n$z\u003d1$, uncertainties $\\Delta b_{\\phi} \\lesssim 1$ and $\\Delta b_{\\phi\\delta}\n\\lesssim 5$ around values close to the fiducial can yield relatively unbiased\nconstraints on $f_{\\rm NL}$ using power spectrum and bispectrum data. We also\nshow why priors on galaxy bias are useful even in analyses that fit for\nproducts $f_{\\rm NL} b_{\\phi}$ and $f_{\\rm NL} b_{\\phi\\delta}$. The strategies\nwe discuss to deal with galaxy bias uncertainties can be straightforwardly\nimplemented in existing $f_{\\rm NL}$ constraint analyses (we provide fits for\nsome of the bias relations). Our results motivate more works with galaxy\nformation simulations to refine our understanding of $b_{\\phi}$ and\n$b_{\\phi\\delta}$ towards improved constraints on $f_{\\rm NL}$.\n",

Despite\nmany efforts, the precise underlying reasons are yet to be discovered. We study\nthe role of linear causality in the VIX index and its derivatives during\nJanuary and February 2018. Due to the shortcomings of statistical inferences\nfor stochastic volatility models, the dynamics of the volatility expectation\nindex VIX remain controversial. Leveraging intraday data, we discover novel\nempirical results describing their interaction. We find bidirectional causality\nbetween the VIX spot and the implied volatility of Standard and Poors 500\noptions, suggesting a volatility feedback effect. The spot index tends to be\nlagging its own futures, while the vector autoregressions error correction\nmechanism reveals a significant mean-reverting equilibrium relationship. The\nevidence is consistent with recent theories indicating that implied volatility\nhas stronger feedback than realized volatility.

In the\nmathematical finance community, it has therefore emerged a new paradigm, named\nrough volatility modeling, that represents the volatility dynamics of financial\nassets as a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst exponent very small, which\nindeed produces rough paths. At the same time, prices\u0027 time series have been\nshown to be multiscaling, characterized by different Hurst scaling exponents.\nThis paper assesses the interplay, if present, between price multiscaling and\nvolatility roughness, defined as the (low) Hurst exponent of the volatility\nprocess. In particular, we perform extensive simulation experiments by using\none of the leading rough volatility models present in the literature, the rough\nBergomi model. A real data analysis is also carried out in order to test if the\nrough volatility model reproduces the same relationship. We find that the model\nis able to reproduce multiscaling features of the prices\u0027 time series when a\nlow value of the Hurst exponent is used but it fails to reproduce what the real\ndata say. Indeed, we find that the dependency between prices\u0027 multiscaling and\nthe Hurst exponent of the volatility process is diametrically opposite to what\nwe find in real data, namely a negative interplay between the two.\n",

A large amount of\ngenomic data is now distributed through consortia like The Cancer Genome Atlas\n(TCGA), where specific types of biological information on specific type of\ntissue or cell are available. In cancer research, the challenge is now to\nperform integrative analyses of high-dimensional multi-omic data with the goal\nto better understand genomic processes that correlate with cancer outcomes,\ne.g. elucidate gene networks that discriminate a specific cancer subgroups\n(cancer sub-typing) or discovering gene networks that overlap across different\ncancer types (pan-cancer studies). In this paper, we propose a novel mixed\ngraphical model approach to analyze multi-omic data of different types\n(continuous, discrete and count) and perform model selection by extending the\nBirth-Death MCMC (BDMCMC) algorithm initially proposed by\n\\citet{stephens2000bayesian} and later developed by\n\\cite{mohammadi2015bayesian}.

Finally, an application to the TCGA breast\ncancer data shows that integrating genomic information at different levels\n(mutation and expression data) leads to better subtyping of breast cancers.\n",

        "paperAbstract": "  Quantification of heritability is a fundamental desideratum in genetics,\nwhich allows an assessment of the contribution of additive genetic variation to\nthe variability of a trait of interest. The traditional computational\napproaches for assessing the heritability of a trait have been developed in the\nfield of quantitative genetics. However, the rise of modern population genomics\nwith large sample sizes has led to the development of several new machine\nlearning based approaches to inferring heritability. In this paper, we\nsystematically summarize recent advances in machine learning which can be used\nto infer heritability. We focus on an application of these methods to bacterial\ngenomes, where heritability plays a key role in understanding phenotypes such\nas antibiotic resistance and virulence, which are particularly important due to\nthe rising frequency of antimicrobial resistance. By designing a heritability\nmodel incorporating realistic patterns of genome-wide linkage disequilibrium\nfor a frequently recombining bacterial pathogen, we test the performance of a\nwide spectrum of different inference methods, including also GCTA. In addition\nto the synthetic data benchmark, we present a comparison of the methods for\nantibiotic resistance traits for multiple bacterial pathogens. Insights from\nthe benchmarking and real data analyses indicate a highly variable performance\nof the different methods and suggest that heritability inference would likely\nbenefit from tailoring of the methods to the specific genetic architecture of\nthe target organism.\n",

        "paperAbstract": "  The contribution to an organism\u0027s phenotype from one genetic locus may depend\nupon the status of other loci. Such epistatic interactions among loci are now\nrecognized as fundamental to shaping the process of adaptation in evolving\npopulations. Although little is known about the structure of epistasis in most\norganisms, recent experiments with bacterial populations have concluded that\nantagonistic interactions abound and tend to de-accelerate the pace of\nadaptation over time. Here, we use a broad class of mathematical fitness\nlandscapes to examine how natural selection biases the mutations that\nsubstitute during evolution based on their epistatic interactions. We find\nthat, even when beneficial mutations are rare, these biases are strong and\nchange substantially throughout the course of adaptation. In particular,\nepistasis is less prevalent than the neutral expectation early in adaptation\nand much more prevalent later, with a concomitant shift from predominantly\nantagonistic interactions early in adaptation to synergistic and sign epistasis\nlater in adaptation. We observe the same patterns when re-analyzing data from a\nrecent microbial evolution experiment. Since these biases depend on the\npopulation size and other parameters, they must be quantified before we can\nhope to use experimental data to infer an organism\u0027s underlying fitness\nlandscape or to understand the role of epistasis in shaping its adaptation. In\nparticular, we show that when the order of substitutions is not known to an\nexperimentalist, then standard methods of analysis may suggest that epistasis\nretards adaptation when in fact it accelerates it.\n",

        "paperAbstract": "  The last decade has seen increasing theoretical and empirical support for\nbeneficial reversals of dominance enabling selection to maintain genetic\nvariation for fitness through various forms of genetic tradeoffs. Dominance\nreversals are characterized by the beneficial allele for a given context (e.g.,\nniche, time, trait or sex) being dominant in that context. This\ncontext-dependence at least partially mitigates the fitness consequence of\nheterozygotes carrying one of the \u0027wrong\u0027 alleles for their context and can\nresult in balancing selection that maintains both alleles. Despite being\ndismissed by some early on, dominance reversals are an inevitable outcome of\nantagonistic selection under reasonable assumptions, and mounting empirical\nevidence largely supports this theory. Here we review the theory and empirical\nevidence for beneficial reversals of dominance. Along the way, we identify some\nareas in need of further research and development, point out some complications\nwith contemporary approaches for detecting genetic tradeoffs, and highlight\nmethods that leverage signatures of dominance reversal toward identifying\ngenetic tradeoffs. There is ample scope for the development of new empirical\nmethods that focus on signatures of dominance reversal, and there is likely\nalso an abundance of data that are ripe for reanalysis. A greater focus on this\ntopic would expand our understanding of the maintenance of genetic variance and\nlocal adaptation.\n",

GSPA is statistically\nstraightforward, reducing to classical gene set enrichment through a single\nuser-defined parameter.

        "paperAbstract": "  Inferring concerted changes among biological traits along an evolutionary\nhistory remains an important yet challenging problem. Besides adjusting for\nspurious correlation induced from the shared history, the task also requires\nsufficient flexibility and computational efficiency to incorporate multiple\ncontinuous and discrete traits as data size increases. To accomplish this, we\njointly model mixed-type traits by assuming latent parameters for binary\noutcome dimensions at the tips of an unknown tree informed by molecular\nsequences. This gives rise to a phylogenetic multivariate probit model. With\nlarge sample sizes, posterior computation under this model is problematic, as\nit requires repeated sampling from a high-dimensional truncated normal\ndistribution. Current best practices employ multiple-try rejection sampling\nthat suffers from slow-mixing and a computational cost that scales\nquadratically in sample size. We develop a new inference approach that exploits\n1) the bouncy particle sampler (BPS) based on piecewise deterministic Markov\nprocesses to simultaneously sample all truncated normal dimensions, and 2)\nnovel dynamic programming that reduces the cost of likelihood and gradient\nevaluations for BPS to linear in sample size. In an application with 535 HIV\nviruses and 24 traits that necessitates sampling from a 12,840-dimensional\ntruncated normal, our method makes it possible to estimate the across-trait\ncorrelation and detect factors that affect the pathogen\u0027s capacity to cause\ndisease.

Many scientists, however, have begun using\nhigh-throughput sequencing technologies to measure gene expression. As the\nresulting high-dimensional count data consists of counts of sequencing reads\nfor each gene, Gaussian graphical models are not optimal for modeling gene\nnetworks based on this discrete data. We develop a novel method for estimating\nhigh-dimensional Poisson graphical models, the Log-Linear Graphical Model,\nallowing us to infer networks based on high-throughput sequencing data. Our\nmodel assumes a pair-wise Markov property: conditional on all other variables,\neach variable is Poisson.

Additionally, we\ndevelop a fast parallel algorithm, an approach we call the Poisson Graphical\nLasso, permitting us to fit our graphical model to high-dimensional genomic\ndata sets. In simulations, we illustrate the effectiveness of our methods for\nrecovering network structure from count data.

Our simulations show a clear\nmanifestation of the evolution towards spatial mass segregation and evolution\ntowards energy equipartition during and at the end of the violent relaxation\nphase. We study the final rotational kinematics and show that massive stars\ntend to rotate more rapidly than low-mass stars around the axis of cluster\nrotation. Our analysis also reveals that during the violent relaxation phase,\nmassive stars tend to preferentially segregate into orbits with angular\nmomentum aligned with the cluster\u0027s angular momentum, an effect previously\nfound in the context of the long-term evolution of star clusters driven by\ntwo-body relaxation.\n",

        "title": "First Stars. I. Evolution without mass loss",
        "paperAbstract": "  The first generation of stars was formed from primordial gas. Numerical\nsimulations suggest that the first stars were predominantly very massive, with\ntypical masses M \u003e 100 Mo. These stars were responsible for the reionization of\nthe universe, the initial enrichment of the intergalactic medium with heavy\nelements, and other cosmological consequences. In this work, we study the\nstructure of Zero Age Main Sequence stars for a wide mass and metallicity range\nand the evolution of 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 Mo galactic and pregalactic Pop\nIII very massive stars without mass loss, with metallicity Z\u003d10E-6 and 10E-9,\nrespectively. Using a stellar evolution code, a system of 10 equations together\nwith boundary conditions are solved simultaneously. For the change of chemical\ncomposition, which determines the evolution of a star, a diffusion treatment\nfor convection and semiconvection is used. A set of 30 nuclear reactions are\nsolved simultaneously with the stellar structure and evolution equations.\nSeveral results on the main sequence, and during the hydrogen and helium\nburning phases, are described. Low metallicity massive stars are hotter and\nmore compact and luminous than their metal enriched counterparts. Due to their\nhigh temperatures, pregalactic stars activate sooner the triple alpha reaction\nself-producing their own heavy elements. Both galactic and pregalactic stars\nare radiation pressure dominated and evolve below the Eddington luminosity\nlimit with short lifetimes. The physical characteristics of the first stars\nhave an important influence in predictions of the ionizing photon yields from\nthe first luminous objects; also they develop large convective cores with\nimportant helium core masses which are important for explosion calculations.\n",

        "paperAbstract": "  The evolution of massive stars is affected by a variety of physical processes\nincluding convection, rotation, mass loss and binary interaction. Because these\nprocesses modify the internal chemical abundance profiles in multiple ways\nsimultaneously, it can be challenging to determine which properties of the\nstellar interior are primarily driving the overall evolution. Building on\nprevious work, we develop a new modelling approach called SNAPSHOT that allows\nus to isolate the key features of the internal abundance profile that drive the\nevolution of massive stars. Using our approach, we compute numerical stellar\nstructure models in thermal equilibrium covering key phases of stellar\nevolution. For the main sequence, we demonstrate that models with the same mass\nand very similar surface properties can have different internal distributions\nof hydrogen and convective core masses. We discuss why massive stars expand\nafter the main sequence and the fundamental reasons for why they become red,\nblue or yellow supergiants. For the post-main sequence, we demonstrate that\nsmall changes in the abundance profile can cause very large effects on the\nsurface properties. We also discuss the effects that produce blue supergiants\nand the cause of blue loops. Our models show that massive stars with lower\nmetallicity tend to be more compact due to the combined effect of lower CNO\nabundances in the burning regions and lower opacity in the envelope.\n",

We\nemploy full 3D general-relativistic multi-group neutrino\nradiation-hydrodynamics and simulate the post-bounce evolutions of progenitors\nwith zero-age main sequence masses of $12$, $15$, $20$, $27$, and\n$40\\,M_\\odot$. All progenitors, with the exception of the $12\\,M_\\odot$ star,\nexperience shock runaway by the end of their simulations. In most cases, a\nstrongly asymmetric explosion will result. We find three qualitatively distinct\nevolutions that suggest a complex dependence of explosion dynamics on\nprogenitor density structure, neutrino heating, and 3D flow. (1) Progenitors\nwith massive cores, shallow density profiles, and high post-core-bounce\naccretion rates experience very strong neutrino heating and neutrino-driven\nturbulent convection, leading to early shock runaway. Accretion continues at a\nhigh rate, likely leading to black hole formation. (2) Intermediate progenitors\nexperience neutrino-driven, turbulence-aided explosions triggered by the\narrival of density discontinuities at the shock. These occur typically at the\nsilicon/silicon-oxygen shell boundary. (3) Progenitors with small cores and\ndensity profiles without strong discontinuities experience shock recession and\ndevelop the 3D standing-accretion shock instability (SASI). Shock runaway\nensues late, once declining accretion rate, SASI, and neutrino-driven\nconvection create favorable conditions. These differences in explosion times\nand dynamics result in a non-monotonic relationship between progenitor and\ncompact remnant mass.\n",

Eight new mid-eclipse times were\ndetermined and the orbital ephemeris was updated. Our result shows that the\norbital period of WZ Sge is decreasing at a rate of\n$\\dot{P}\u003d-2.72(\\pm0.23)\\times{10^{-13}}\\,s s^{-1}$. This secular decrease,\ncoupled with previous detection of its donor, suggest that WZ Sge is a\npre-bounce system. Further analysis indicates that the observed period decrease\nrate is about $1.53$ times higher than pure gravitational radiation (GR)\ndriving. We constructed the evolutionary track of WZ Sge, which predicts that\n$P_{min}$ of WZ Sge is $\\sim77.98 (\\pm0.90)$ min. If the orbital period\ndecreases at the current rate, WZ Sge will evolve past its $P_{min}$ after\n$\\sim25.3$ Myr.
