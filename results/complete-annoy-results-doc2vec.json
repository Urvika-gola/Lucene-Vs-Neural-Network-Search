In this paper, we propose an encryption learning\nframework to address the problems of data leakage and inconvenient disclosure\nof sensitive data in certain domains. We introduce multiple encryption\nalgorithms to encrypt training data in the named entity recognition task for\nthe first time. In other words, we train the deep neural network using the\nencrypted data. We conduct experiments on six Chinese datasets, three of which\nare constructed by ourselves. The experimental results show that the encryption\nmethod achieves satisfactory results. The performance of some models trained\nwith encrypted data even exceeds the performance of the unencrypted method,\nwhich verifies the effectiveness of the introduced encryption method and solves\nthe problem of data leakage to a certain extent.\n",

        "paperAbstract": "  In this paper, we propose a novel generative model-based attack on learnable\nimage encryption methods proposed for privacy-preserving deep learning. Various\nlearnable encryption methods have been studied to protect the sensitive visual\ninformation of plain images, and some of them have been investigated to be\nrobust enough against all existing attacks. However, previous attacks on image\nencryption focus only on traditional cryptanalytic attacks or reverse\ntranslation models, so these attacks cannot recover any visual information if a\nblock-scrambling encryption step, which effectively destroys global\ninformation, is applied. Accordingly, in this paper, generative models are\nexplored to evaluate whether such models can restore sensitive visual\ninformation from encrypted images for the first time. We first point out that\nencrypted images have some similarity with plain images in the embedding space.\nBy taking advantage of leaked information from encrypted images, we propose a\nguided generative model as an attack on learnable image encryption to recover\npersonally identifiable visual information. We implement the proposed attack in\ntwo ways by utilizing two state-of-the-art generative models: a StyleGAN-based\nmodel and latent diffusion-based one. Experiments were carried out on the\nCelebA-HQ and ImageNet datasets. Results show that images reconstructed by the\nproposed method have perceptual similarities to plain images.\n",

By using the no-signalling postulate, we show\nthat the scheme can resist attack to the key.

        "paperAbstract": "  Dempster-Shafer theory is widely applied in uncertainty modelling and\nknowledge reasoning due to its ability of expressing uncertain information. A\ndistance between two basic probability assignments(BPAs) presents a measure of\nperformance for identification algorithms based on the evidential theory of\nDempster-Shafer. However, some conditions lead to limitations in practical\napplication for Dempster-Shafer theory, such as exclusiveness hypothesis and\ncompleteness constraint. To overcome these shortcomings, a novel theory called\nD numbers theory is proposed. A distance function of D numbers is proposed to\nmeasure the distance between two D numbers. The distance function of D numbers\nis an generalization of distance between two BPAs, which inherits the advantage\nof Dempster-Shafer theory and strengthens the capability of uncertainty\nmodeling. An illustrative case is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed function.\n",

It is important to study the\nproperties of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies through both\nobservations and simulations and compare their results in order to understand\ntheir physics and formative histories.We find that Illustris prediction for\nsupermassive black hole mass relative to pitch angle is in rather good\nagreement with observations and that barred and non-barred galaxies follow\nsimilar scaling relations. Our work shows that Illustris presents very tight\ncorrelations between supermassive black hole mass and large-scale properties of\nthe host galaxy, not only for early-type galaxies but also low-mass, blue and\nstar-forming galaxies. These tight relations beyond the bulge suggest that halo\nproperties determine those of a disc galaxy and its supermassive black hole.\n",

        "paperAbstract": "  Quantification of heritability is a fundamental desideratum in genetics,\nwhich allows an assessment of the contribution of additive genetic variation to\nthe variability of a trait of interest. The traditional computational\napproaches for assessing the heritability of a trait have been developed in the\nfield of quantitative genetics. However, the rise of modern population genomics\nwith large sample sizes has led to the development of several new machine\nlearning based approaches to inferring heritability. In this paper, we\nsystematically summarize recent advances in machine learning which can be used\nto infer heritability. We focus on an application of these methods to bacterial\ngenomes, where heritability plays a key role in understanding phenotypes such\nas antibiotic resistance and virulence, which are particularly important due to\nthe rising frequency of antimicrobial resistance. By designing a heritability\nmodel incorporating realistic patterns of genome-wide linkage disequilibrium\nfor a frequently recombining bacterial pathogen, we test the performance of a\nwide spectrum of different inference methods, including also GCTA. In addition\nto the synthetic data benchmark, we present a comparison of the methods for\nantibiotic resistance traits for multiple bacterial pathogens. Insights from\nthe benchmarking and real data analyses indicate a highly variable performance\nof the different methods and suggest that heritability inference would likely\nbenefit from tailoring of the methods to the specific genetic architecture of\nthe target organism.\n",

        "paperAbstract": "  Exploratory cancer drug studies test multiple tumor cell lines against\nmultiple candidate drugs. The goal in each paired (cell line, drug) experiment\nis to map out the dose-response curve of the cell line as the dose level of the\ndrug increases. We propose Bayesian Tensor Filtering (BTF), a hierarchical\nBayesian model for dose-response modeling in multi-sample, multi-treatment\ncancer drug studies. BTF uses low-dimensional embeddings to share statistical\nstrength between similar drugs and similar cell lines. Structured shrinkage\npriors in BTF encourage smoothness in the dose-response curves while remaining\nadaptive to sharp jumps when the data call for it. We focus on a pair of cancer\ndrug studies exhibiting a particular pathology in their experimental design,\nleading us to a non-conjugate monotone mixture-of-Gammas likelihood. To perform\nposterior inference, we develop a variant of the elliptical slice sampling\nalgorithm for sampling from linearly-constrained multivariate normal priors\nwith non-conjugate likelihoods. In benchmarks, BTF outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods for covariance regression and dynamic Poisson matrix factorization. On\nthe two cancer drug studies, BTF outperforms the current standard approach in\nbiology and reveals potential new biomarkers of drug sensitivity in cancer.\nCode is available at https://github.com/tansey/functionalmf.\n",

We study with this model the\nconditions under which sexual reproduction is advantageous and can evolve in\nthe context of autocorrelated or directionally varying environments, mutational\nbiases, spatial heterogeneities and phenotypic plasticity. Our results\ngeneralize and unify previous analyses. We also examine the proposal made by\nGeodakyan that the presence of two phenotypically distinct sexes permits an\noptimal adaptation to varying environments.

        "paperAbstract": "  In this study we present a new experimental design using clustering-based\nredshift inference to measure the evolving galaxy luminosity function (GLF)\nspanning 5.5 decades from $L \\sim 10^{11.5}$ to $ 10^6 ~ \\mathrm{L}_\\odot$. We\nuse data from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey and the Kilo-Degree\nSurvey (KiDS). We derive redshift distributions in bins of apparent magnitude\nto the limits of the GAMA-KiDS photometric catalogue: $m_r \\lesssim 23$; more\nthan a decade in luminosity beyond the limits of the GAMA spectroscopic\nredshift sample via clustering-based redshift inference. This technique uses\nspatial cross-correlation statistics for a reference set with known redshifts\n(in our case, the main GAMA sample) to derive the redshift distribution for the\ntarget ensemble. For the calibration of the redshift distribution we use a\nsimple parametrisation with an adaptive normalisation factor over the interval\n$0.005 \u003c z \u003c 0.48$ to derive the clustering redshift results. We find that the\nGLF has a relatively constant power-law slope $\\alpha \\approx -1.2$ for $-17\n\\lesssim M_r \\lesssim -13$, and then appears to steepen sharply for $-13\n\\lesssim M_r \\lesssim -10$. This upturn appears to be where Globular Clusters\n(GCs) take over to dominate the source counts as a function of luminosity. Thus\nwe have mapped the GLF across the full range of the $z \\sim 0$ field galaxy\npopulation from the most luminous galaxies down to the GC scale.\n",

Thus various\nimputation methods using sequential SNPs data have been proposed based on\nstatistical or deep learning models, e.g. CNN-based model, named DEEP*HLA.\nHowever, imputation efficiency is not sufficient for in frequent alleles and a\nlarge size of reference panel is required. Here, we developed a\nTransformer-based model to impute HLA alleles, named \"HLA Reliable IMputatioN\nby Transformer (HLARIMNT)\" to take advantage of sequential nature of SNPs data.\nWe validated the performance of HLARIMNT using two different reference panels;\nPan-Asian reference panel (n \u003d 530) and Type 1 Diabetes Genetics Consortium\n(T1DGC) reference panel (n \u003d 5,225), as well as the mixture of those two panels\n(n \u003d 1,060). HLARIMNT achieved higher accuracy than DEEP*HLA by several\nindices, especially for infrequent alleles. We also varied the size of data\nused for training, and HLARIMNT imputed more accurately among any size of\ntraining data. These results suggest that Transformer-based model may impute\nefficiently not only HLA types but also any other gene types from sequential\nSNPs data.\n",

        "paperAbstract": "  In the genome biology research, regulatory genome modeling is an important\ntopic for many regulatory downstream tasks, such as promoter classification,\ntransaction factor binding sites prediction. The core problem is to model how\nregulatory elements interact with each other and its variability across\ndifferent cell types. However, current deep learning methods often focus on\nmodeling genome sequences of a fixed set of cell types and do not account for\nthe interaction between multiple regulatory elements, making them only perform\nwell on the cell types in the training set and lack the generalizability\nrequired in biological applications. In this work, we propose a simple yet\neffective approach for pre-training genome data in a multi-modal and\nself-supervised manner, which we call GeneBERT. Specifically, we simultaneously\ntake the 1d sequence of genome data and a 2d matrix of (transcription factors x\nregions) as the input, where three pre-training tasks are proposed to improve\nthe robustness and generalizability of our model. We pre-train our model on the\nATAC-seq dataset with 17 million genome sequences. We evaluate our GeneBERT on\nregulatory downstream tasks across different cell types, including promoter\nclassification, transaction factor binding sites prediction, disease risk\nestimation, and splicing sites prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of multi-modal and self-supervised pre-training for\nlarge-scale regulatory genomics data.\n",

Statistical analyses of the data highlight that certain\nintervals (e.g., the octave, fifth, second) are used frequently across\ncultures. Despite some diversity among scales, it is the similarities across\nsocieties which are most striking - most scales are found close to equidistant\n5- and 7-note scales.

However, there are several challenges associated with big\ndata-based e-commerce recommender systems. These challenges include limited\nresources, data validity period, cold start, long tail problem, scalability. In\nthis paper, we discuss the challenges and potential solutions to overcome these\nchallenges. We also discuss the different types of e-commerce recommender\nsystems, their advantages, and disadvantages.

Consequently one always generalizes the\nCartesian prescription to other coordinates and falls in a trap. In this work\nwe introduce the difficulties one faces when the question of the momentum\noperator in spherical polar coordinate comes. We have tried to point out most\nof the elementary quantum mechanical results, related to the momentum operator,\nwhich has coordinate dependence. We explicitly calculate the momentum\nexpectation values in various bound states and show that the expectation value\nreally turns out to be zero, a consequence of the fact that the momentum\nexpectation value is real. We comment briefly on the status of the angular\nvariables in quantum mechanics and the problems related in interpreting them as\ndynamical variables. At the end, we calculate the Heisenberg\u0027s equation of\nmotion for the radial component of the momentum for the Hydrogen atom.\n",
